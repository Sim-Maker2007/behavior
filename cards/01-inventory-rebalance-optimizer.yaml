problem_pattern:
  category: "constrained-resource-allocation"
  description: >
    Allocates finite resources across multiple locations to minimize
    stockouts while respecting budget constraints, lead times, and
    demand uncertainty.

  analogous_domains:
    - domain: "humanitarian-aid-distribution"
      similarity: 0.82
      notes: >
        Medical supply allocation to field hospitals maps closely.
        Key difference: demand signals are weaker and more volatile.
    - domain: "energy-grid-balancing"
      similarity: 0.65
      notes: >
        Similar constraint structure but time horizons differ significantly.
        Energy requires sub-second decisions vs. daily/weekly for inventory.

  reasoning:
    method: "multi-objective-optimization"
    objectives:
      - "minimize projected stockouts (weight: 0.6)"
      - "minimize transfer cost (weight: 0.3)"
      - "minimize transfer complexity (weight: 0.1)"
    approach: >
      Uses rolling demand forecast with Monte Carlo uncertainty
      sampling, then applies constrained optimization to find
      Pareto-optimal transfer plans.

domain_assumptions:
  data_assumptions:
    - id: "DA-001"
      assumption: "Demand follows seasonal patterns with historical data available"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        In crisis/humanitarian contexts, demand is shock-driven not seasonal.
        Replace seasonal model with surge detection + needs assessment feeds.

    - id: "DA-002"
      assumption: "Inventory data is digitized and updated within 4 hours"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        Many humanitarian warehouses use manual tracking. Requires either
        digitization step or tolerance for 24-48h data latency.

    - id: "DA-003"
      assumption: "Item taxonomy is stable and well-defined"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Aid supply taxonomies vary by organization. Map to standard
        humanitarian clusters (WASH, Shelter, Health, etc.)

  environment_assumptions:
    - id: "EA-001"
      assumption: "Transfer routes are known and relatively stable"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        In crisis zones, routes change daily. Requires integration with
        real-time logistics/access data (e.g., OCHA access maps).

    - id: "EA-002"
      assumption: "Single currency, stable pricing"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Multi-currency and volatile pricing in global humanitarian ops.
        Add currency normalization layer.

  authority_assumptions:
    - id: "AA-001"
      assumption: "Agent can recommend but human approves transfers over $10K"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        Humanitarian contexts often require cluster-level coordination
        approval. Expand approval workflow to multi-stakeholder.

    - id: "AA-002"
      assumption: "Single organization controls all inventory"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        Humanitarian supply chains involve multiple orgs (UN, NGOs, govts).
        Requires federated inventory visibility without full data sharing.
