  reasoning:
    method: "monte-carlo-scenario-simulation-with-decision-analysis"
    objectives:
      - "Identify credible worst-case scenarios (weight: 0.3)"
      - "Quantify resource requirements for adequate response (weight: 0.4)"
      - "Prepare decision-makers to act decisively under crisis (weight: 0.3)"
    approach: >
      Multi-stage: (1) Define scenario trigger event and initial conditions,
      (2) Model uncertainty: Monte Carlo sampling of demand drivers
      (population influx rate, disease transmission, supply chain disruptions),
      (3) Simulate cascade of impacts using domain-specific models,
      (4) For each simulation path, compute resource requirements and
      compare to capacity to identify bottlenecks, (5) Run sensitivity
      analysis: which assumptions matter most? (6) Model decision points:
      at what population threshold do we activate emergency procurement?
      At what case load do we request international support? (7) Optimize
      decision thresholds to balance early action (cost, false alarms)
      vs. late action (inadequate response), (8) Generate contingency plans
      and preparedness assessments.

# DOMAIN ASSUMPTIONS
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
domain_assumptions:
  data_assumptions:
    - id: "DA-001"
      assumption: "Historical data reliably predicts future scenarios"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Financial stress testing: historical volatility used to model
        future shocks. Refugee crises: historical data may not predict new
        conflicts (low-frequency events). Use INFORM risk index, expert
        elicitation, and intelligence assessments to supplement historical data.
        Scenario probabilities should be validated by domain experts, not
        derived from limited history.

    - id: "DA-002"
      assumption: "Probability distributions are accurate"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Financial: volatility smile is well-studied. Humanitarian: probability
        of scenarios is highly uncertain. Build wide confidence intervals.
        Model tail risks explicitly (low-probability high-impact events).
        Update probabilities as new intelligence arrives.

    - id: "DA-003"
      assumption: "Impact models are linear or well-understood"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Financial: fairly linear (doubling market volatility ≈ doubles losses).
        Humanitarian: highly nonlinear and chaotic. Refugee influx compounds
        with disease (crowding, poor sanitation). Conflict disrupts supply
        chains (sudden lockdowns, route closures). Model nonlinearities and
        tipping points. Test model assumptions with domain experts.

    - id: "DA-004"
      assumption: "Scenarios are independent or correlations are known"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Financial: correlation structures studied. Humanitarian: crises
        cluster (climate stress + conflict often co-occur). Model known
        correlations. Leave uncertainty bounds for unknown correlations.

  environment_assumptions:
    - id: "EA-001"
      assumption: "Decision-makers can act within planning timeline"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Financial: minutes (trading). Humanitarian: procurement and logistics
        take weeks or months. Build lead time realism into scenarios. Pre-position
        resources before crisis hits. Decision thresholds must trigger early
        actions (purchase orders, staff recruitment) not late reactions
        (emergency appeals for funds).

    - id: "EA-002"
      assumption: "Resources can be marshaled from global system"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        Financial: capital flows globally. Humanitarian: supply chains
        disrupted by conflict, customs delays, port closures. Scenario
        planning must account for local supply constraints. Consider supply
        chain localization and pre-positioning as mitigation.

    - id: "EA-003"
      assumption: "Neutrality and impartiality are feasible"
      strength: "soft"
      adaptation_note: >
        If scenario planning is weaponized (conflict predictions used to favor
        one side), neutrality breaks. Scenario planning must serve neutral
        humanitarian response, not military or political goals. Restrict
        access to sensitive scenarios; vet distribution carefully.

  authority_assumptions:
    - id: "AA-001"
      assumption: "Scenarios inform but don't constrain decision-maker options"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        Scenario planning explores possibilities, not prescriptions. Human
        decision-maker retains authority to deviate from recommended plans
        based on real-time intelligence, political constraints, or humanitarian
        judgment. Scenarios are tools, not oracles.

    - id: "AA-002"
      assumption: "Contingency plans are activated by designated authorities"
      strength: "hard"
      adaptation_note: >
        Same in both domains. Clear decision authority chains. Thresholds
        for activating contingency actions (e.g., population > 100,000
        triggers emergency procurement). Escalation protocols for crises
        exceeding local capacity.

        Scenarios that predict conflict can become intelligence if disclosed.
        Humanitarian organizations must maintain impartiality and neutrality.
        If crisis planning is shared with one combatant side, neutrality is
        compromised.
      recommendation: >
        Separate public preparedness work (natural disasters, epidemiology)
        from sensitive conflict scenario planning. Conflict scenarios kept
        for internal coordination with other neutral organizations, not shared
        with governments or combatants. If conflict prediction is released
        publicly, must be presented neutrally (risks to all populations, not
        supporting one side). Explicitly renounce use of scenario planning
        for military purposes.

    - context: "humanitarian-crisis-planning"
      concern: >
        Scenario planning that focuses only on quantified impacts (deaths,
        displacement) may miss dignity and human dimensions. Planning may
        become technocratic (optimize cost-effectiveness) rather than
        humanitarian (preserve human rights and dignity in crisis).
      recommendation: >
        Impact projections must include qualitative humanitarian impacts:
        separation of families, sexual violence, mental health trauma, loss of
        livelihoods. Contingency plans must include protection components, not
        just logistics. Decision-making includes humanitarian principles
        (humanity, impartiality, neutrality, independence), not just
        cost-effectiveness. Involve affected communities in scenario planning
        and contingency design.

    - context: "any"
      concern: >
        Over-emphasis on preparing for known scenarios may leave organization
        blind-sided by novel crises (black swan events). Scenario planning
        can create false confidence ("we're prepared") that leads to
        complacency.
      recommendation: >
        Explicitly include "wildcard" scenarios: low-probability high-impact
        events that don't fit standard categories (pandemic + earthquake,
        cascading cyber attacks, rapid climate shift). Include "pre-mortem"
        exercise: imagine scenario unfolded worst possible way; what could
        have been done better? Use outcomes to improve flexibility and
        adaptive capacity, not just plan execution.

  performance:
    tested_scale: "Scenarios modeling 500,000-5,000,000 affected population"
    latency: >
      Single scenario simulation: 10-30 minutes (depending on model complexity).
      Batch Monte Carlo (10,000 scenarios): 4-8 hours. Interactive scenario
      exploration: 2-5 minutes per scenario. Annual planning exercise: 2-3 weeks
      (intensive collaboration with partners).
    accuracy: >
      Point estimates for well-understood processes (food requirement per
      person) are highly accurate. Cascade dynamics (conflict → displacement →
      disease → death) are less predictable. Confidence intervals typically
      50-100% of point estimate (wide bounds reflect uncertainty). Scenario
      planning is about exploring possibility space, not predicting specifics.
    known_degradation: >
      Accuracy drops for: novel crises (no historical precedent), highly
      dependent on political decisions (hard to model), chaotic dynamics
      (weather, conflict), and assumption failures (supply chain collapses
      in ways not foreseen). In these cases, scenarios become less reliable;
      emphasize adaptive planning and real-time monitoring.

  observability:
    logging: "All scenarios, assumptions, and impact models versioned and documented"
    explainability: >
      Each scenario output includes: trigger event, initial conditions,
      assumptions, impact mechanisms, resource requirements, and decision
      points. Sensitivity analysis shows which assumptions drive outcomes.
      Contingency plans show decision logic: "IF displaced population >
      100,000 THEN activate emergency procurement."
    reproducibility: >
      Deterministic given same scenario definitions, parameters, and model
      versions. Model versions tracked. Changes to scenarios or assumptions
      documented and require approval before re-running. Allows comparison of
      "old plan vs. new plan given new intelligence."

        Forked for humanitarian crisis scenario planning and preparedness.
        Replaced financial shock scenarios with humanitarian crisis scenarios
        (conflict, disease, natural disaster), replaced portfolio VaR with
        population impact modeling, adapted resource calculator to humanitarian
        supply and logistics, integrated Sphere Standards for adequacy thresholds,
        and added decision-tree analysis for contingency activation.
